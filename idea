have custmizable image to ascii art with all the normal settings.
you can export an animation as a gif where the sontrast of the source image is animated from 0 to some target value,so it seems as if the subject is just appraignn out of the characters. Theres also an option to export it as a look, so the animation goes o → X → 0
